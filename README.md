# systemjstest
reproducing the bug

Access http://systemjstest.vcsoft.com.br/ or clone this repo and set nginx like the server.nginx file in this repo.
Open the console and reload the page several times. Sometime a entry property will be added to module2 metadata and a invalid module will be requested.
